Carpentries lessons are all hosted on GitHub, and contributing to them requires familiarity with:
- the file structure in the repo (which files should you edit)
- tracking changes with Git
- how to preview your changes locally
- how to submit a pull request

Today's skill-up session tackles all of these topics.


> ## Prerequisites
>
> Learners should be familiar with using Git:
> - making commits
> - working in feature branches
> - pushing to remote repository
>
> This lesson uses Git from the command line, and so is easiest followed from a command prompt.
>
> Jekyll is used to build a local copy of the lessons --- it isn't absolutely required to follow
> this course, but would be very useful if you could [install jekyll][jekyll] on your machine.
