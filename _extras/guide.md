## Episode 2
After the PR exercise in episode 1, the instructor should show the PRs on GitHub,
and select one to use as an example to request changes.

## Episode 3
After the exercise in episode 2,
the instructor should make an edit to the *discussion* page and push the change
to simulate someone else's PR having been merged.

Alternatively, a helper could submit a PR and the instructor could merge it
so the learners have a genuine scenario to handle.

In order to re-use this lesson, the instructor should do a hard reset
so that the discussion page is empty again.
